# CMPSC221_FINAL
This is my final project for CMPSC 221. This project was to create a course scheduling application with two types of users, Admin and Student. The Admin user is able to perform multiple functions to set up a database so that the Student users may schedule courses.

This application has a GUI interface with a Derby database (not included in the github).
